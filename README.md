## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Surya-Kaliappan/chat-um.git
    cd chat-um
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### **Environment Variables**

You will need to create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

1.  **Backend (`server/.env`):**

    ```env
    PORT = 1234
    JWT_KEY = "your_super_secret_jwt_key"
    ORIGIN = "http://localhost:5173"
    DATABASE_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017/chat-um"
    ```

2.  **Frontend (`client/.env`):**

    ```env
    VITE_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:1234"
    ```

### **Running the Application**

You will need to run the frontend and backend servers in two separate terminals.

1. **Start the backend server:**

   From the `backend` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file.

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

    From the frontend directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The application should now be running. Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
